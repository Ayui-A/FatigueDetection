# FatigueDetection
A CV program that detects driver fatigue 
This program is a basic computer vision program to detect if a person's eye is close which can be used for a fatigure detection problem

The 2 xml files are the classifiers used for this code
if it randomly beeps for no reason its probably a lighting problem
if u close your eye for about 1 second it should beep

for better accuracy try to replace the rectangles for eyes with an elipse
